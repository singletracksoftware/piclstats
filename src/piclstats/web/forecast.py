"""Rider performance forecasting engine.

Predicts where a rider would place in a different division based on
their min/mile pace, adjusted for fatigue (extra laps), loop transition
(MS→HS), and seasonal improvement trends.

The model is configurable via DEFAULT_CONFIG — all tunable parameters
are drawn from this dict rather than hardcoded in the algorithm.
